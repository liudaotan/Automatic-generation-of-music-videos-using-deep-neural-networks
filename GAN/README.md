Here are the models that has been trained(DCGAN):
1. A G net, which uses `torch.randn(64, nz, 1, 1, device=device)` as input, which generates 64*64 images of faces.
2. A D net that discriminates whether a 64*64 image is a real photo or a fake one generated by a generator.

Loaded the trained network (if you load the pre-trained network on a computer without CUDA, you will need to modify some of the code)
Using two random inputs and linearly interpolating between inputs A and B to get the output animation of A -> B.
